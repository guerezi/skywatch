## about

So, initialy i would like to do this project using Bloc and get_it, but i was short in time, so I used a old project that i had to test home widgets. The archtecture is not the best and need some time to get used to it, but is very modular and easy to expand (even tho its very verbose).

I could not complete de video part, sorry, I had just thusday at the very night and this friday night to do the project and get caried away with not so important fatures, i should make the new address register simpler and use less uncessary things, like the GPS, drawer and theme. 

The Video part would be like any other repo, It's  a know limitation for this archtecture a way to deal with streams in usecases, its all mess up, but i would find a way. About the weather, I have a lot of data and didn't find a propper way to show it, the image on the background should also change.

The tests was sadly also shortened, I did a baic model test for the weather, since it was bigger, the usecases and repositories need a more in depth look, It is not hard to develop such tests, again, I was sadly limited by time.
